Title: The Dual-State Value Theory: A Framework for Trust, Value, and Human Economics

Author: Joseph Patrick Mooney

Abstract:
This work introduces the Dual-State Value Theory, a novel philosophical-economic framework grounded in the metaphors of potential and kinetic states of value. It frames money, trust, and assets within a balance sheet where value is not only measured but enacted. The model reconciles the apparent paradox of items like gold being simultaneously measures of value and objects of valuation by distinguishing between their potential (stored/trust-backed) and kinetic (mobilized/transferred) states. Trust emerges as a binding energy within the system, influencing the transference, stability, and collapse of value across time. This theory attempts to integrate insights from both absolute and relativistic moral frameworks, individual vs. collective dynamics, and introduces real-world examples, spiritual parallels, and economic interpretations. The result is a comprehensive attempt to reconceptualize monetary systems not merely as economic mechanisms but as moral and philosophical expressions of human civilization.
