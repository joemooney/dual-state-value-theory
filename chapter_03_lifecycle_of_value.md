Chapter 3: The Lifecycle of Value
Every unit of value—whether a dollar, a deed, or a data stream—traces a path from genesis to exhaustion. The Dual-State Model frames this journey as a lifecycle of transformation from potential to kinetic and, eventually, back again. Understanding this lifecycle helps us make sense of everything from business cycles to generational wealth to the rise and fall of institutions.

At the inception of value, we often find intention: a purpose, a desire, a plan. A business loan is granted with the intent of creating goods or services; an inheritance is bequeathed to enable future security. These are reservoirs of potential value—concentrated, stored, and pregnant with possibility.

The moment this potential is deployed, it becomes kinetic. The business purchases equipment, hires staff, and enters the market. The inheritance is invested, spent on education, or used to start a family. This is the active, dynamic phase where risk, friction, and external forces act on the value in motion. The outcomes are rarely linear or guaranteed. Mistakes are made. Discoveries occur. Value may increase, decrease, or be transmuted into less tangible forms such as experience or reputation.

After kinetic value has completed its arc, it either dissipates or condenses into a new reservoir of potential. Profits become savings. Knowledge becomes intellectual capital. Influence becomes legacy. This final transformation often resets the cycle, passing value forward to new stewards or systems.

But there are also failure modes in this lifecycle. Value can become stranded—locked in inaccessible forms like unredeemable tokens, unused patents, or unspent hoards. Value can also become corrupted—hijacked by deception, inflated by false signals, or drained by parasitic systems. These breakdowns serve as cautionary tales and emphasize the importance of discernment and adaptability.

Ultimately, the lifecycle of value reveals the temporal nature of economic and moral worth. Nothing of value remains fixed indefinitely. Every asset, every trust, every fortune must be stewarded through time, risk, and relational terrain. The best systems acknowledge this fluidity and build in rituals of renewal—sabbaths, audits, rites of passage—that help convert kinetic exhaust into potential wisdom.

In later chapters, we will explore how different schools of economics interpret or ignore this lifecycle. For now, we establish it as a foundational rhythm: the pulse of value as it breathes, moves, rests, and transforms.
