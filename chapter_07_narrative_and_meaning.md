# Chapter 7: Narrative and Meaning – Trust's Dependence on Story

## Key Concepts

- Value systems are narrative systems — currency as a story we tell and believe
- Bitcoin's origin myth and narrative of sovereignty — rebellion against fiat and centralization
- Gold as the oldest trusted story — elemental, incorruptible, enduring
- Fiat as the state-backed narrative — collective coercion to maintain trust
- Narrative collapse and monetary collapse — Weimar, Zimbabwe, Venezuela
- Competing stories as currency wars — ideological struggle via economic tools
- Shared myths and coherence — trust arises when stories align among actors
- Propaganda and manipulation of trust — dangerous potential in centralized narrative control
- Language as monetary medium — metaphors, slogans, and semantic framing
- Advertising as narrative monetization — selling stories to build trust in products
- Brand trust as micro-narrative — loyalty built on consistency and perceived integrity
- The role of influencers and modern bards — storytellers shaping economic reality
- Conspiracy theories and rogue trust channels — distrust breeds alternative myths
- Religion as a long-term trust narrative — value grounded in metaphysical continuity
- Decentralized narratives in Web3 — collaborative meaning-making
- Narrative inflation — too many competing stories, leading to meaning devaluation
- Narrative as defense against manipulation — critical thinking as value preservation
- Authenticity as narrative capital — trust flows to the real
- The medium shapes the story — tech platforms as narrative scaffolding
- Storytelling as ethical act — the moral weight of crafting value narratives
