# Dual State Economic Theory
**A New Lens for Understanding Value and Trust**

*By Joseph Patrick Mooney*

---

## Welcome

This site presents a comprehensive exploration of **Dual State Economic Theory** - a new lens for examining how value moves between potential states (measurement systems, stored trust) and kinetic states (active exchange, realized utility) across economic systems.

## Core Thesis

**Total System Value (TSV) = Total System Honesty (TSH)**

This fundamental equation links economic value directly to moral integrity, proposing that all value exists in dual states analogous to potential and kinetic energy in physics.

## Key Contributions

This framework introduces several novel concepts:

1. **Trust as Quantifiable Resource** - Measurable substrate of all economic value
2. **Potential/Kinetic Value Duality** - Physics metaphor applied to monetary systems  
3. **Moral Transaction Theory** - Every exchange as a trust wager with ethical implications
4. **Regenerative Trust Systems** - Anti-fragile design principles for post-collapse renewal
5. **Reflexive Balance Sheet Model** - Resolution of self-referential monetary paradoxes

## Academic Positioning

This work sits at the intersection of:
- **Economics** - Formal models of trust dynamics
- **Philosophy** - Moral foundations of value
- **Theology** - Divine grounding of trust and redemption
- **Systems Theory** - Complex adaptive systems

## About the Author

Joseph Patrick Mooney developed this theory through collaborative exploration with AI, representing a synthesis of insights from multiple disciplines. The work challenges purely materialist economic frameworks by integrating spiritual and moral dimensions as foundational elements.
