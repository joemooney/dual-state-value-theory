3. Use wisdom tradition quotes to bridge secular and spiritual perspectives
4. Use universal wisdom quotes to connect to broader human experience

### For Emphasis
- **Trust quotes** should appear throughout as trust is the binding concept
- **System quotes** work well in analytical sections

- **Spiritual quotes** provide transcendent grounding for material discussions

### Formatting Recommendations
- Use block quotes for major thematic quotes
- Integrate shorter quotes inline with attribution
