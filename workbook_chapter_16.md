## Personal Value System Design

### Core Values Identification
1. **List potential values**: Honesty, justice, compassion, excellence, creativity, etc.
2. **Prioritize ruthlessly**: Choose only 3-5 core values to focus on
3. **Define specifically**: What does each value mean in practical terms?
4. **Test through scenarios**: How would these values guide difficult decisions?
5. **Commit publicly**: Share your values with trusted friends for accountability

### Decision-Making Framework
**The DSVM Ethics Filter:**
1. **Trust Test**: Does this action build or erode trust?
2. **Value Test**: Does this align with my stated core values?
3. **Stakeholder Test**: Who is affected and how?
4. **Time Test**: How will I feel about this decision in 10 years?
5. **Universal Test**: What if everyone did this?
6. **Conscience Test**: Can I do this with a clear conscience?

### Personal Mission Statement
Craft a personal mission statement that includes:
- Your purpose in life
- The values that guide you
- The kind of trust legacy you want to leave
- How you want to contribute to human flourishing
